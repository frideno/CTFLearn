given the c# code Program.cs
we run it:

* Welcome to the CTF 6502 challenge!                                  *
*                                                                     *
* This 6502 assembly program should process the flag data and make it *
* readable, but the data in the memory dump looks corrupted.          *
* I guess there's a bug in the assembly program, or maybe in the      *
* emulator? This `OPCODE_0x49`-method looks strange...                *

need to implement mos 6502 instruction - opcode 0x49 = EOR which is xor.
so we can see that in the program:
  static readonly byte[] program = {
            0xa2, 0x00,                 // LDX #$00
            0xb5, 0x00,                 // LDA $00,X
            0x00, 0x00,
            0x95, 0x40,                 // STA $40,X
            0xe8,                       // INX
            0xe0, (byte)flag.Length,    // CPX #${flag.Length}
            0xd0, 0xf5,                 // BNE $0604d
            0xa9, 0xff                  // LDA #$ff
        };
there is not 0x49 opcode called.
we can get flag:
static readonly byte[] flag = {
            0x4B,0x5C,0x4E,0x64,0x6D,0x69,0x7A,0x66,
            0x73,0x60,0x38,0x65,0x3B,0x57,0x6B,0x38,
            0x65,0x78,0x7D,0x7C,0x3B,0x7A,0x57,0x7A,
            0x3B,0x7E,0x38,0x64,0x7D,0x7C,0x39,0x38,
            0x66,0x75
        };
which is flag="'K\\Ndmizfs`8e;Wk8ex}|;zWz;~8d}|98fu'"
and simply bruteforce with xor of i in range(256)
to get:
CTFlearn{h0m3_c0mput3r_r3v0lut10n}

while solving this, i learned the idea of writing a machine emulator:
memory, cpu and opcodes, registers, flags and it was fun.

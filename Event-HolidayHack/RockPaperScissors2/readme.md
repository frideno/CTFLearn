this time, the numbers are really twisted.
after a reasearch and using the bolded hint "twisted", we found that this has to do with Mersen twister.
i found mersen twister predictor python package on github.
what it does is by having 624 outputs of random numbers generated by mersen twister prng, it can predict the next outputs.
i tried it first, and it worked.
i wrote a python script part2.py, which gets 624 outputs for 'R' inputs.
it saves the 'basedOn' in array, and then feed them to the predictor.
then the predictor can give us the next 30 numbers. we convert them to 'R','P' or 'S' by x%3, and save in array the winning move over each of them, and print it.
then we enter the winning moves until it gives us the flag:

python part2.py
and there it is:

Wow, you're good, here's your flag!
CTFlearn{m3rs3nn3_kind4_c00l}

note: the missoion says that after 30 inputs it will give the flag, but it is only 9. that made a bug in my code and i thought it had to do something with the connection timeout, and was stuck on it.
